Please go through the DeadCellsPaths.bat file and replace the file paths for root with where youre Deadcells.exe file is located.
Replace the Mod Tools file path only if you have moved them somewhere else, otherwise leave this as default.
Replace the Reasorces file path with where you want the files to be unpacked. 
    If files are unpacked to the same place twice they WILL be replaced 
The output is where the (final) packed file will go, feel free to leave this as defult (can be changed it to your steam workshop folder).
